# [Problem Solving](https://www.linkedin.com/messaging/thread/6740254028388683776/)

### Motivation.
Our main motivation for creating this repository links back to a [LinkedIn group](https://www.linkedin.com/messaging/thread/6740254028388683776/) where we (all JavaScript developers) decided to collaborate upon one platform where we will be solving coding challenges weekly ([HackerRank Problem Solving](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/algorithms?badge_type=problem-solving) challenges for now) and posting our solutions here.

### Procedure.
1. Each week, we will be solving 3 to 4 challenges picked from `HackerRank Problem Solving` series.
2. A new `GitHub branch` will be created each week, where the `ReadMe` file will contain the `links` for the `challenges` that will be solved that week.
3. Participants are expected to `clone the repository` to their systems, switch to the `branch` that they want to work on, make a `folder` with their `name` in the branch.
4. Inside the folder with their name, participant has to make a `new file` for each `challenge` that they want to solve and solve the challenge in it.
5. Once they are done solving the challenges, they will make a `pull request` in to the relevant `branch` where they had solved the challenges.
6. After some safety and consistency checks, one of the `contributors` of this repository will accept the  `pull request`, hence, the participant will also have their code included in the repository.
